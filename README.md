Sprouting Fit Wordpress Theme Files

The business owners required a website to be developed and created.  They already had assets such as logos and images.
We sketched out ideas together using pen and paper, until a wireframe was created.  This physical wireframe was then translated into a HTML prototype, before being converted into a custom Wordpress template.

So that the clients could easily update their own website (their speciality is outdoor personal training, which is subject to the season), it was decided that a CMS would allow them the flexibility to update when they required it.  The blogging functionality of Wordpress was deactivated for their install.

The theme includes index.php, header.php, footer.php, three page.php files and two style.css files, one IE specific.

This repo does not contain assets such as fonts and images.
